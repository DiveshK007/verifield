# VeriField — One Pager

**Problem**: Research & climate datasets are fragmented, hard to trust, and difficult to access.  
**Solution**: A BNB-native marketplace where contributors upload to **Greenfield (sponsored)**, mint **DataNFTs** on **BSC**, and buyers discover & purchase datasets with **AI semantic search**. A **Verified** badge provides trust.

**Why BNB**: Greenfield sponsor-paid uploads + delegate flows deliver **no-gas UX** for contributors; cross-chain programmability connects storage and settlement seamlessly.

**MVP (demo)**:
1) Upload → Greenfield (sponsored)
2) Mint DataNFT
3) List & purchase on BSC testnet
4) Grant download permission on Greenfield
5) Verified badge toggle

**Tracks**: DeSci • DePIN (citizen data) • DeSoc (reputation) • AI (semantic search)

**Roadmap**: Staking-based curation, dataset bounties, compute-to-data jobs, institutional partnerships.
